1. Linear Regression Model:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 3.116163013178e+20
   - R-squared: -5.127382421446022e+21
   - Comments: Extremely poor performance, possibly due to violation of linear regression assumptions.

2. Random Forest Regressor (Default Parameters):
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.04219514334594888
   - R-squared: 0.30571463897272344
   - Comments: Better performance than the Linear Regression model. The model explains approximately 30.57% of the variance in the target variable.

3. Gradient Boosting Regressor (Default Parameters):
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.04405501916053564
   - R-squared: 0.27511195702875413
   - Comments: Similar performance to the Random Forest model, but with slightly lower R-squared.

Hyperparameter Tuning for Random Forest Regressor:
- Best Parameters:
   - Max Depth: None
   - Min Samples Leaf: 4
   - Min Samples Split: 2
   - Number of Estimators: 200
- Best Score (Neg MSE): -0.04265617783956185
- Comments: Slight improvement in MSE compared to the untuned model. Indicates potential for further optimization.

Conclusion:
- Linear Regression is not suitable for this dataset.
- Both Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models show promise, with Random Forest having a slight edge.
- Hyperparameter tuning shows potential for further improvements in model performance.
